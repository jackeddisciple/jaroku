"""Provider selection — the one place a generated agent's model is chosen.

Generated code never constructs a model (hard rule 2 of the generation prompt). It receives
one already configured. That is what makes the provider dropdown a real feature rather than
a regeneration: the same generated project runs on the free dry-run model, on Claude, or on
GPT, decided here at spawn time from ``JAROKU_PROVIDER`` / ``JAROKU_MODEL``.

Note on sampling parameters: no ``temperature`` is passed. Current Claude models (Opus 4.7+,
Sonnet 5, Fable 5) reject ``temperature``/``top_p``/``top_k`` with a 400, so passing it would
break exactly the models a user is most likely to pick.
