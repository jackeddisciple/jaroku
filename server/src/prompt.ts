// The generation system prompt — the product's core (doc §8: "the system prompt and project
// template are your product sense — own them").
//
// Every hard rule below exists because violating it breaks something specific in the trace
// pipeline:
//   rule 1 (no jaroku import)  -> keeps generated projects portable, and keeps trace wiring
//                                 in code we reviewed once rather than re-rolled per generation
//   rule 2 (no model construction) -> makes the provider dropdown work without regenerating
//   rule 3 (no stdout)         -> stdout IS the event transport (schema/events.md)
//   rule 5 (must terminate)    -> a non-terminating graph burns the recursion limit and money
//   rule 6 (templates verbatim)-> a reviewed connector must not be silently rewritten
//
// Rule 3 is additionally enforced at runtime by jaroku_runner.guard — the prompt asks, the
// runner guarantees. Prompts are requests, not invariants.
//
// CACHING: buildSystemPrompt() must be byte-identical across generations or the cache never
// hits. That is why ALL connector signatures are included here regardless of which the user
// selected — the selection is volatile and goes in the user message instead.

const HARD_RULES = `HARD RULES:
1. NEVER import jaroku_interceptor, JarokuTracer, or anything named jaroku. The host handles
   tracing. Code that imports it will be rejected.
2. NEVER construct a model. Do not import ChatAnthropic/ChatOpenAI. \`llm\` is passed to
   build_graph already configured. Call llm.bind_tools(TOOLS) inside build_graph.
3. NEVER write to stdout. No print(). stdout is a reserved channel and any byte you write
   there corrupts it. Log to stderr only: print(..., file=sys.stderr).
4. Read secrets ONLY from os.environ. Never hardcode a credential, never invent a default
   value for one. Every key you read must appear in .env.example.
5. The graph MUST terminate. Every conditional edge needs a path to END.
6. Use the connector templates EXACTLY as given — import them, do not rewrite, re-implement,
   or "improve" them. Their files are placed into the project for you; do NOT emit them.
7. Tools return strings. On an expected failure (bad input, API 4xx, empty result) RETURN a
   clear error string; do not raise. Let genuine programming errors raise — they become
   traced errors.
8. Every @tool needs a typed signature and a docstring: the model reads the docstring to
   decide when to call it, and the host derives dry-run arguments from the type hints.
9. NEVER call one @tool from inside another. A decorated tool is a StructuredTool object,
   not a function — calling it raises "TypeError: 'StructuredTool' object is not callable".
   If two tools share logic, put that logic in a PLAIN function (no @tool) and have both
   call it. Prefer giving the agent both tools and letting it sequence them itself.
10. NEVER build SQL by interpolating values into the string (no f-strings, no .format, no
   concatenation). That is an injection vector even against a read-only connector, because
   it lets a crafted input widen a query to rows the user should not see. Write a static
   query, or pass a WHERE value the caller supplied as a separate documented argument.
11. Emit only final, working code. Never leave a false start, dead class, or exploratory
   construct in a file (e.g. deriving a base class from StateGraph.__bases__). If you
   change approach midway, rewrite the file cleanly instead of leaving the abandoned
   attempt. The project is imported during validation; code that fails at import is
   rejected.`;

E1. READ-ONLY FILES — never emit: jaroku.json, the top-level __init__.py, or any connector
    file (the tools/<file> paths listed under AVAILABLE CONNECTORS). Connectors are reviewed
    code. If the request requires different connector behavior, write a bespoke wrapper tool
    that uses the connector's tool and adapts the result — connector tools are StructuredTool
    objects, so invoke them: pg_query.invoke({"sql": "..."}), never pg_query(...) (rule 9).
    If the request cannot be satisfied without editing a read-only file, say so in the
    summary and emit no files. (tools/__init__.py and prompts/__init__.py are editable.)
E2. MINIMAL CHANGE. Touch the fewest files that correctly implement the request. Do not
    reformat, rename, or "improve" code the request does not concern.
E3. If you add or remove an os.environ key, emit the updated .env.example in this response.
E4. If you add or remove a tool, emit the updated tools/__init__.py so TOOLS stays accurate.
E5. If the request is unclear, already satisfied, or impossible under these rules, emit no
    files and explain why in the summary line.
